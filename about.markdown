Hello! I am Unni, an `empathetic programmer` from Bangalore. I `love to code`, infact I am passionate about producing `clean code` that follows `SOLID` design principles.

This Blog was created an attempt to improve my learning process. While learning algorithms I realized that there is a pattern to my learning process. It is generally a 4 step process.

1. Google a lot to find resources that are easy to understand for `my Brain`. It can be a well written article or a good Youtube video. 

2. Spend substantial amount of time trying to internalize the contents of the identified resources.

3. Do some coding practice in the language of my choice to gain confidence on the implementation.

4. Attempt some problems (in leetcode or any similar site) related to the algorithm.

This looks perfect, but the problem that I am facing is that, I tend to forget what I learned after a short period of time. It is natural, because bulk of what you learn is stored in your short term memory. Only the key hook points (the very interesting stuff) gets into your long term memory. At a later point, when I want to revise the same topic, I go through the exact 4 steps again. 

This blog is an attempt to speedup my internalization process and revision cycle. I came to a conclusion that my learning process is basically a transpilation process where I convert some high level content created by others into another high level content that my brain can easily understand. Lot of times, this transpilation process is boring because there is not enough element of creativity in it, particularly when you are learning an algorithm. By blogging about a topic, you bring in an element of creativity to the learning process. Unknowingly what you are doing is, you are increasing the key hook points or the interesting stuff so that your brain gets stimulated and absorbs more content into it's long term memory. But you would still need the revision cycle, may be in a less frequent duration. When I go through the revision cycle, I just read my own blog. Since it's written in a language that is easily understandable by my brain, I am able to quickly load the stuff into my volatile memory, without again going through the transpilation process.

It has been working well so far and I think that's the science behind it.

I decided to write it down, firstly because the About page was almost empty ;-)... also, I ended up explaining the rational behind it to a friend of mine. Since I am a strong proponent of DRY principle, I don't want to repeat the same stuff to another colleague or friend of mine.
